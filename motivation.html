<h1>Overview</h1>
<div class="intro">


<p>So a workflow is effectively an orchestration.</p>

<p>You want a workflow, because it gives you a way to decompose a complex series
of operations down to a sequence of discreet tasks with a state machine.</p>

<p>The sequence of tasks is more complex than just a series. The tasks of course
can fail, and so you need to deal with timeouts, retries, "stuck" flows, etc.</p>

<p>You can define a workflow and its tasks using an arbitrarily complex language.
Or you can keep it simple by taking some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code is the definition language.</li>
<li>Tasks are independent. Can be used into different workflows.</li>
<li>The only way of communication between tasks is the workflow. Tasks can add,
remove or modify properties of the workflow.</li>
<li>If a task requires a specific property of the workflow to be present, the
task can fail, or re-schedule itself within the workflow, or ...</li>
</ul>


</div>
<h1 id="system-design">System design</h1>

<p>System needs to be designed with failures in mind. Tasks can fail and, as a
consequence, workflows may fail. You may want to recover from a task failure,
or from a whole workflow failure.</p>

<p>The system itself may also fail due to any unexpected reason.</p>

<h2 id="Terminology"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Terminology</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Task</em>: A single discreet operation, such as Send Email.</li>
<li><em>Workflow</em>: An abstract definition of a sequence of Tasks, including
transition conditions, and branches.</li>
<li><em>Job</em>: An instance of a Workflow containing all the required information
to execute itself and, eventually, a target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="System-components"><span class="method name"><span class="name">System components</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A workflow and task <strong>factory</strong>, where you can create tasks, workflows and queue
jobs, using NodeJS.</li>
<li>Alongside the <strong>factory</strong>, <strong>Workflow API</strong> will allow creation of tasks,
workflows and jobs through a REST API using any other language, with JSON as
the payload.</li>
<li>An <strong>Status API</strong>, where you can check the status of a given job, get information
about failures, ...</li>
<li><strong>Job runners</strong>. You can have as many runners as you want. Runners can live
everywhere. Once a runner "picks" a job, that job is flagged with the runner
identifier so no other runner attempts to execute it. One runner can be
composed of multiple associated processes to execute jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The factory talks to a <strong>persistence layer</strong>, and saves workflows and tasks. Also,
once a Job is created, it's saved with all the required information, including
the tasks code at the moment of job creation. This will <strong>avoid any potential
problems resulting of underlaying modifications of tasks once a Job has been
queued</strong>.</p>

<p>A runner itself may go dive nuts while a job is being executed, leaving the
job into an unappropriated <em>"running"</em> status. When a runner starts, there
shouldn't be any job flagged with the runner identifier and, furthermore,
it shouldn't be on a running status. If that happens, the first thing a runner
must do on restart is to pick any job into such invalid state and execute
the fall-back recovery branch for such job.</p>

<h2 id="Recursion-and-Branches"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Recursion and Branches</span></span></h2>

<p>Imagine you have a task and, as the fall-back for the case that task fails,
you specify that same task. Not very useful; not too bad since the fall-back
task will also fail and, as a consequence, the workflow will fail ...</p>

<p>... wait!, or will call the workflow's failure branch which may also contain
<em>the same task!</em> which, obviously, will fail again.</p>

<p>So, first rule: When a task is specified as part of a workflow, that same task
can not be specified as the task itself <code>onerror</code> fall-back, neither to the
workflow's <code>onerror</code> branch.</p>

<p>Now, let's think about the following scenario: a job is created as the result
of some action, for example, a GET request to a given REST URI. Then, as part
of the workflow's tasks, another GET request is made to the same REST URI,
which will obviously result into infinite number of jobs being created to do
exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>Job's target property may help us on avoiding this infinite loop problem. While
a Workflow is something "abstract", a Job may "operate" over a concrete target.
For example, you can use a REST URI as the target of the job, or an LDAP DN, or
whatever you need to make sure that the same job will not be queued twice.</p>

<p>When jobs are created and queued, they will check if another job with the same
target (and the same parameters) exists and, if that's the case, the job creation
will fail.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are some cases where you may want the same job to be queued
exactly for the same target; for example, POST to a given URI to create a new
collection element. That's the reason job's <code>parameters</code> are also checked with
job's <code>target</code> in order to allow or not creation and queueing of a new job.</p>

<p>In the case a job has failed for a given target and parameters, you may want to
create a new one after some time. This is perfectly possible since the previous
job uniqueness checks are made only versus "running" or "queued" jobs, not versus
"finished" jobs, whatever is their result.</p>

<p>Finally, a note about multiple branches:</p>

<p>In theory, one may want to specify any arbitrary number of branches to be
executed depending on workflow's tasks results. That would bring us into a complex
scenario where we should take decisions like: <em>should we allow the same task to
be specified as part of several different branches?</em>.</p>

<p>So far I haven't got a clear answer for that. In theory, only the fall-backs
should be different than their respective tasks, and the workflow's <code>onerror</code>
chain shouldn't contain any of the tasks specified as part of any of the other
branches.</p>

<p>Anyhow, can we imagine a concrete scenario where multiple branches are required?.
I mean, with an example. If so, we can take care of things like avoiding
recursion and infinite loops being caused there, but I'm thinking we'd rather
care of that once we find the example.</p>

<h1 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h1>

<ol>
<li>You need a way to define tasks.</li>
<li>Need a way to define a workflow.</li>
<li>Need a way to add tasks to a workflow. Sometimes specify the exact position
of a task on the workflow chain.</li>
<li>Need a way to remove tasks from the workflow. Some tasks may be able to flag
themselves as no-removable.</li>
<li>A task can fail.</li>
<li>You need to know how many times you want to retry a task in case of failure.</li>
<li>You need to know what to do when a task fail. Fail the workflow?, try a
different branch?, ...</li>
<li>A task can be stuck.</li>
<li>You need to know when to timeout a task.</li>
<li>You need to know what to do when a given task timeout is over.</li>
<li>You need to be able to instantiate a workflow in order to create a Job.</li>
<li>A Job may have parameters.</li>
<li>A Job may have a target.</li>
<li>You need to run a Job.</li>
<li>A job may have an acceptable period of time to be completed.</li>
<li>At job end, you may want to be able to specify another job to be completed.</li>
<li>Of course, you want to know the results of each task execution.</li>
<li>You may want to know the workflow status at any moment.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Task-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Task properties</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A name,</li>
<li>code to be executed,</li>
<li>timeout,</li>
<li>number of retries, when proceed</li>
<li><p>a fall-back task to be executed when the task fails.</p>

<pre><code>{
  name: 'A Task',
  timeout: 30,
  retry: 2,
  body: function(job, cb) {
    if (!job.foo) {
      job.foo = true;
      return cb('Foo was not defined');
    }
    return cb(null);
  }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a task's timeout shouldn't be bigger than the workflow timeout, but
it really doesn't matter. If a task execution exceeds the workflow timeout it
will be failed with 'workflow timeout' error.</p>

<h2 id="Workflow-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Workflow properties</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A name.</li>
<li>The 'chain' of tasks to be executed.</li>
<li>A global timeout.</li>
<li>Alternate error branch.</li>
<li><p>Optionally, another workflow to execute right after the current one is completed.</p>

<pre><code>factory.workflow({
  name: 'Sample Workflow',
  chain: [aTask, anotherTask, aTaskWhichWillFail],
  timeout: 300,
  onError: [aFallbackTask]
}, function(err, workflow) {
  if (err) {
    throw(err);
  }
  return workflow;
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Job-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Job properties</span></span></h2>

<p>Same than the workflow plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Results for each one of the tasks (we need to decide about tasks results format)</li>
<li>The job target, when given.</li>
<li>The job parameters, when necessary.</li>
<li>The job status (something like "queued", "running", "finished" may work).
Note that a job is running while a task is being executed. It's perfectly
possible to change job status to "queued" once a task has been completed, and
leave the job there to be picked by a runner at some later moment.</li>
<li>When to run the job. May we want to delay execution in time?.</li>
<li><p>Any additional property a task may want to save with the job to be used by
a subsequent task.</p>

<pre><code>factory.job({
  workflow: aWorkflow,
  exec_after: '2012-01-03T12:54:05.788Z'
}, function(err, job) {
  if (err) {
    callback(err);
  }
  aJob = job;
  callback(null, job);
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Some questions about other jobs options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we want to be able to "abort" a job?.</li>
<li>Even if it's running?</li>
<li>And, if so, what to do when it's running and we abort?, call <code>onerror</code>
branch?, (note I'm beginning to think that <code>onerror</code> should be called
<code>revert</code> sometimes, or maybe it's just an extra branch ...).</li>
</ul>

<p>See <code>example.js</code> for a detailed description on how to create Tasks, Workflows
and Jobs using NodeJS through the <strong>factory</strong> component.</p>

<h2 id="Workflow-Runners"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Workflow Runners</span></span></h2>

<p>The system design requires that we can have workflow runners everywhere. As
many as needed, and all of them reporting health periodically. Also, it would
be desirable that runners could implement a <code>ping</code> method to provide immediate
information about their status.</p>

<p>All runners will periodically query the backend for information about other
runners and, in case they detect one of those runners has been inactive for a
configurable period of time, they will check for stale jobs associated with
the inactive runner and either fail those jobs or run the associated <code>onerror</code>
branch.</p>

<p>The first thing a runner does when it boots, is to register itself on the
backend, (which is the same as report its health). At a configurable interval
a runner will try to pick queued jobs and execute them. Runners will report
activity at this same interval.</p>

<p>Every runner must have an unique identifier, which can be passed at runner's
initialization, (or it will be auto-generated the first time the runner is
created and saved for future runs).</p>

<p>Runners will spawn child processes, one process per job. Max number of child
processes is also configurable.</p>

<h3> How runners pick and execute jobs</h3>

<p>A runner will query the backend for queued jobs, (exactly the same number of
them than available child processes to spawn). Once the runner gets a set of
these queued jobs, it will try to obtain an exclusive lock on each job before
processing it. When a job is locked by a runner, it will not be found by other
runners searching for queued jobs.</p>

<p>Once the runner has the exclusive lock over the job, it'll change job status
from <em>queued</em> to <em>running</em>, and begin executing the associated tasks.</p>

<p>In order to execute the job, the runner will spawn a child process, and pass
it all the information about the job. (Child processes don't have access to
the backend, just to the job, which must be a JSON object).</p>

<p>Note that everything must be executed within the acceptable amount of time
provided for the job. If this time expires, the job execution will fail and
the <code>onerror</code> branch will be executed when given.</p>

<h3>Task execution:</h3>

<p>Workflow runner will then try to execute the <code>job</code> chain of tasks, in order.
For every task, the runner will try to execute the task <code>body</code>, using NodeJS
VM API. Every task will get as arguments the job and a callback. A task should
call the callback once it's completed.</p>

<pre><code>// A task body:
function(job, cb) {
  // Task stuff here:
  cb(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If a task succeeds, it will call the callback without <code>error</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cb(null);
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the task should call the callback with an error message:</p>

<pre><code>cb('whatever the error reason');
</code></pre>

<p>These error messages will be available for the task's <code>onerror</code> function, in
order to allow a task's fallback to decide if it can recover the task from a
failure.</p>

<p>It's also possible to set an specific timeout for every task execution.</p>

<p>Either if a task fails, or if the task timeout is reached, the runner will
check if we've exceeded the number of retries for the task and, if that's not
the case, it'll try to execute the task again.</p>

<p>Once the max number of retries for a task has been reached, the runner will
check if the task has an <code>onerror</code> fallback and, when that's the case, it'll
call it with the error which caused the failure, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>task.onerror(error, job, cb);
</code></pre>

<p>The same logic than for tasks bodies can be applied to <code>onerror</code> fallbacks.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>tasks run sandboxed</strong>. Only the node modules we specify to the
runner at initialization time, alongside with <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>clearTimeout</code>,
<code>setInterval</code> and <code>clearInterval</code> global functions will be available for
task <code>body</code> and <code>onerror</code> functions. (This will be configurable).</p>

<p>All the tasks results will be saved sorted at the job's property
<code>chain_results</code>. For every task, the results will be something like:</p>

<pre><code>{
  error: '',
  results: 'OK'
}
</code></pre>

<p>or, for a task which failed:</p>

<pre><code>{
  error: 'Whatever the error reason',
  results: ''
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the task fails because its <code>onerror</code> fallback failed, or because the task
doesn't has such fallback, the job's <code>onerror</code> chain will be invoked if
present.</p>

<p>The logic to execute the job's <code>onerror</code> chain is exactly the same than we've
described here for the main <code>chain</code> of tasks.</p>

<p>Once the job is finished, either successfully or right after a failure, or even
in the case a task tells the runner to <em>re-queue</em> the job, due to whatever the
reason, the child process running the job will communicate the runner the
results, and the runner will save back those results into the backend, either
finishing the job, or re-queueing it for another runner which may fetch it in
order to continue its execution at a later time.</p>
