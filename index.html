<h1>Overview</h1>
<div class="intro">


<p>Either if you are building a completely new system composed of many discreet API
applications, each of them with a clearly defined area of responsibility, or
in the case you are trying to assemble a collaboration channel between an
heterogeneous set of totally unrelated API applications, you need a way to
orchestrate interactions between these applications.</p>

<p>So a workflow is effectively an orchestration.</p>

<p>You want a workflow, because it gives you a way to decompose a complex series
of operations down to a sequence of discreet tasks with a state machine.</p>

<p>The sequence of tasks is more complex than just a series. The tasks of course
can fail, and so you need to deal with timeouts, retries, "stuck" flows, etc.</p>

<p>You can define a workflow and its tasks using an arbitrarily complex language.
Or you can keep it simple by taking some assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code is the definition language.</li>
<li>Tasks are independent. Can be used into different workflows.</li>
<li>The only way of communication between tasks is the workflow. Tasks can add,
remove or modify properties of the workflow.</li>
<li>If a task requires a specific property of the workflow to be present, the
task can fail, or re-schedule itself within the workflow, or ...</li>
</ul>

<p>System needs to be designed with failures in mind. Tasks can fail and, as a
consequence, workflows may fail. You may want to recover from a task failure,
or from a whole workflow failure.</p>

<p>The system itself may also fail due to any unexpected reason.</p>

<h2>node-workflow</h2>

<p>This package provides a way to define re-usable <code>workflows</code> using JSON and run
concrete <code>jobs</code> with specific <code>targets</code> and <code>parameters</code> based on such
<code>workflows</code>.</p>


</div>
<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>Task</em>: A single discreet operation, such as Send Email.</li>
<li><em>Workflow</em>: An abstract definition of a sequence of Tasks, including
transition conditions, and branches.</li>
<li><em>Job</em>: An instance of a Workflow containing all the required information
to execute itself and, eventually, a target.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="system-components">System components</h1>

<ul>
<li>A workflow and task <strong>factory</strong>, where you can create tasks, workflows and queue
jobs, using NodeJS.</li>
<li>Alongside the <strong>factory</strong>, <strong>Workflow API</strong> will allow creation of tasks,
workflows and jobs through a REST API using any other language, with JSON as
the payload.</li>
<li>An <strong>Status API</strong>, where you can check the status of a given job, get information
about failures, ...</li>
<li><strong>Job runners</strong>. You can have as many runners as you want. Runners can live
everywhere. Once a runner "picks" a job, that job is flagged with the runner
identifier - <em>locked</em> - so no other runner attempts to execute it. One runner
can be composed of multiple associated processes to execute jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The factory talks to a <strong>persistence layer</strong>, and saves workflows and tasks. Also,
once a Job is created, it's saved with all the required information, including
the tasks code at the moment of job creation. This will <strong>avoid any potential
problems resulting of underlaying modifications of tasks once a Job has been
queued</strong>.</p>

<p>A runner itself may go dive nuts while a job is being executed, leaving the
job into an unappropriated <em>"running"</em> status. When a runner starts, there
shouldn't be any job flagged with the runner identifier and, furthermore,
it shouldn't be on a running status. If that happens, the first thing a runner
must do on restart is to pick any job into such invalid state and cancel it.</p>

<h2 id="Task-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Task properties</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A name,</li>
<li>code to be executed,</li>
<li>timeout,</li>
<li>number of retries, when proceed</li>
<li><p>a fall-back task to be executed when the task fails.</p>

<pre><code>{
  name: 'A Task',
  timeout: 30,
  retry: 2,
  body: function(job, cb) {
    if (!job.foo) {
      job.foo = true;
      return cb('Foo was not defined');
    }
    return cb(null);
  },
  fallback: function (err, job, cb) {
    job.the_err = err;
    return cb(null);
  }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a task's timeout shouldn't be bigger than the workflow timeout, but
it really doesn't matter. If a task execution exceeds the workflow timeout it
will be failed with 'workflow timeout' error.</p>

<h2 id="Workflow-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Workflow properties</span></span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A name.</li>
<li>The 'chain' of tasks to be executed.</li>
<li>A global timeout.</li>
<li><p>Alternate error branch.</p>

<pre><code>factory.workflow({
  name: 'Sample Workflow',
  chain: [aTask, anotherTask, aTaskWhichWillFail],
  timeout: 300,
  onError: [aFallbackTask]
}, function(err, workflow) {
  if (err) {
    throw(err);
  }
  return workflow;
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Job-properties"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Job properties</span></span></h2>

<p>While a Workflow is something "abstract", a Job may "operate" over a concrete target.
For example, you can use a REST URI as the target of the job, or an LDAP DN, or
whatever you need to make sure that the same job will not be queued twice.</p>

<p>When jobs are created and queued, they will check if another job with the same
target (and the same parameters) exists and, if that's the case, the job creation
will fail.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are some cases where you may want the same job to be queued
exactly for the same target; for example, POST to a given URI to create a new
collection element. That's the reason job's <code>parameters</code> are also checked with
job's <code>target</code> in order to allow or not creation and queueing of a new job.</p>

<p>In the case a job has failed for a given target and parameters, you may want to
create a new one after some time. This is perfectly possible since the previous
job uniqueness checks are made only versus "running" or "queued" jobs, not versus
"finished" jobs, whatever is their result.</p>

<p>Same than the workflow plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Results for each one of the tasks (we need to decide about tasks results format)</li>
<li>The job target, when given.</li>
<li>The job parameters, when necessary.</li>
<li>The job status (something like "queued", "running", "finished" may work).
Note that a job is running while a task is being executed. It's perfectly
possible to change job status to "queued" once a task has been completed, and
leave the job there to be picked by a runner at some later moment.</li>
<li>When to run the job. May we want to delay execution in time?.</li>
<li><p>Any additional property a task may want to save with the job to be used by
a subsequent task.</p>

<pre><code>factory.job({
  workflow: aWorkflow,
  exec_after: '2012-01-03T12:54:05.788Z'
}, function(err, job) {
  if (err) {
    callback(err);
  }
  aJob = job;
  callback(null, job);
});
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="workflow-api-and-rest-api">Workflow API and REST API.</h1>

<p>You can create <code>workflows</code> and <code>jobs</code> either by using the provided REST API(s),
or by embedding this module's API into your own system(s).
The former will be easier to get up and running, but you should use the latter
when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to use the Worflow API in a (node.js) application that is not the
bundled REST API.</li>
<li>You want to use a different backend storage system, or otherwise change the
assumptions of the bundled REST API</li>
</ul>

<p>The package also provides a binary file to run the <code>WorkflowAPI</code> using the
same configuration file we pass to our <code>WorkflowRunner</code>:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/workflow-api path/to/config.json
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="workflowapi.html">REST API docs</a> for the details of available end-points.</p>

<h1 id="workflow-runners"> Workflow Runners</h1>

<p>In order to execute the <code>jobs</code>, at least one <code>WorkflowRunner</code> must be up and
ready to take jobs. An arbitrary number of <code>runners</code> can be used on any set of
hosts; configuration must match.</p>

<p>An example <code>WorkflowRunner</code> is provided with the package and can be started
with:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/workflow-runner path/to/config.json
</code></pre>

<p>The system design requires that we can have workflow runners everywhere. As
many as needed, and all of them reporting health periodically.</p>

<p>All runners will periodically query the backend for information about other
runners and, in case they detect one of those runners has been inactive for a
configurable period of time, they will check for stale jobs associated with
the inactive runner and cancel those jobs.</p>

<p>The first thing a runner does when it boots, is to register itself on the
backend, (which is the same as report its health). At a configurable interval
a runner will try to pick queued jobs and execute them. Runners will report
activity at this same interval.</p>

<p>Every runner must have an unique identifier, which can be passed at runner's
initialization, (or it will be auto-generated the first time the runner is
created and saved for future runs).</p>

<p>Runners will spawn child processes, one process per job. Max number of child
processes is also configurable.</p>

<h2 id=" How-runners-pick-and-execute-jobs"><span class="method name"><span class="name"> How runners pick and execute jobs</span></span></h2>

<p>A runner will query the backend for queued jobs, (exactly the same number of
them than available child processes to spawn). Once the runner gets a set of
these queued jobs, it will try to obtain an exclusive lock on each job before
processing it. When a job is locked by a runner, it will not be found by other
runners searching for queued jobs.</p>

<p>Once the runner has the exclusive lock over the job, it'll change job status
from <em>queued</em> to <em>running</em>, and begin executing the associated tasks.</p>

<p>In order to execute the job, the runner will spawn a child process, and pass
it all the information about the job. (Child processes don't have access to
the backend, just to the job, which must be a JSON object).</p>

<p>Note that everything must be executed within the acceptable amount of time
provided for the job. If this time expires, the job execution will fail and
the <code>onerror</code> branch will be executed when given.</p>

<h2 id="Task-execution:"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Task execution:</span></span></h2>

<p>Workflow runner will then try to execute the <code>job</code> chain of tasks, in order.
For every task, the runner will try to execute the task <code>body</code>, using NodeJS
VM API. Every task will get as arguments the job and a callback. A task should
call the callback once it's completed.</p>

<pre><code>// A task body:
function(job, cb) {
  // Task stuff here:
  cb(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If a task succeeds, it will call the callback without <code>error</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cb(null);
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the task should call the callback with an error message:</p>

<pre><code>cb('whatever the error reason');
</code></pre>

<p>These error messages will be available for the task's <code>fallback</code> function, in
order to allow it to decide if can recover the task from a failure.</p>

<p>It's also possible to set an specific timeout for every task execution.</p>

<p>Either if a task fails, or if the task timeout is reached, the runner will
check if we've exceeded the number of retries for the task and, if that's not
the case, it'll try to execute the task again.</p>

<p>Once the max number of retries for a task has been reached, the runner will
check if the task has an <code>fallback</code> and, when that's the case, it'll
call it with the error which caused the failure, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>task.onerror(error, job, cb);
</code></pre>

<p>The same logic than for tasks bodies can be applied to <code>fallbacks</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>tasks run sandboxed</strong>. Only the node modules we specify to the
runner at initialization time, alongside with <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>clearTimeout</code>,
<code>setInterval</code> and <code>clearInterval</code> global functions will be available for
task <code>body</code> and <code>fallback</code> functions. (This is configurable).</p>

<p>All the tasks results will be saved sorted at the job's property
<code>chain_results</code>. For every task, the results will be something like:</p>

<pre><code>{
  error: '',
  results: 'OK'
}
</code></pre>

<p>or, for a task which failed:</p>

<pre><code>{
  error: 'Whatever the error reason',
  results: ''
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the task fails because its <code>fallback</code> failed, or because the task
doesn't has such fallback, the job's <code>onerror</code> chain will be invoked if
present.</p>

<p>The logic to execute the job's <code>onerror</code> chain is exactly the same than we've
described here for the main <code>chain</code> of tasks.</p>

<p>Once the job is finished, either successfully or right after a failure, or even
in the case a task tells the runner to <em>re-queue</em> the job, due to whatever the
reason, the child process running the job will communicate the runner the
results, and the runner will save back those results into the backend, either
finishing the job, or re-queueing it for another runner which may fetch it in
order to continue its execution at a later time.</p>

<h1 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h1>

<p>The following is an example configuration for node-workflow, with all the
relevant sections included:</p>

<pre><code>{ 
  backend: {
    module: '../lib/workflow-redis-backend',
    opts: {
      port: 6379,
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      db: 14 
    } 
  },
  api: {
    port: 8080
  },
  runner: {
    identifier: 'cd925eef-93fb-4bfe-a820-2aaedf9fc006',
    forks: 10,
    run_interval: 60,
    sandbox: {
      restify: 'restify',
      uuid: 'node-uuid',
      util: 'util'
    } 
  },
  logger: {
    streams: [ {
      level: 'info',
      stream: process.stdout
    }, {
      level: 'debug',
      path: './some-file.log'
    }]
  } 
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Backend"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Backend</span></span></h2>

<p>Backend configuration has two main sections: <code>module</code> and <code>opts</code>. <code>module</code> value
must be something we can use to load the backend module of choice by issuing
<code>require(backend.module)</code>. It doesn't matter if it's a node.js npm module or a
relative path to the module. The included module must be a class which inherits
from <code>WorkflowBackend</code>.</p>

<p>Then, the <code>opts</code> section is anything required by the chosen backend constructor
to be initialized:</p>

<pre><code>var BackendModule = require(config.backend.module);
var backend = new BackendModule(config.backend.opts);
</code></pre>

<p>Both, API and Runner will communicate with the backend using the configuration
provided on this section.</p>

<h2 id="API"><span class="method name"><span class="name">API</span></span></h2>

<p>Anything you want to pass to <a href="http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/#Creating-a-Server">restify.createServer</a>.
restify's server logger configuration will be the same you provide for logger section.</p>

<p>Note you can pass either a <code>port</code> number or a socket <code>path</code> here too.</p>

<h2 id="Runner"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Runner</span></span></h2>

<p>Configuration for workflow runners. None of the options on this section is required.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>identifier</code>: Unique identifier for a runner. If none given, the first time
a runner is started it will generate an UUID and store it on a file <code>workflow-runner</code>
which will be reused on the subsequent boots.</li>
<li><code>forks</code>: Number of child processes to be forked by the runner, which will also match
the max number of jobs to run in parallel. (10 if nothing given).</li>
<li><code>run_interval</code>: Integer. Time <strong>in seconds</strong> for the runner to: report it is active,
search for new queued jobs to process, search for <em>stale</em> jobs from other runners. Also,
3 times this value is what we'll take to decide if a runner is inactive. It's to say:
if a given runner hasn't reported it's healthy since <code>3 * run_interval</code>, it'll be
considered inactive by other runners, and all the associated jobs will be canceled.
(If nothing is given, 120 seconds is the default value for <code>run_interval</code>).</li>
<li><code>sandbox</code>: node.js modules we want to make available for the VM where we run
our tasks. Note that the key for each member will be the way you can refer to such
object from your tasks <code>body</code> and <code>fallback</code> functions, while the value is what
the system will use to require the module. For example: <code>{uuid: 'node-uuid'}</code>.
Remember that, by default, only <a href="http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/timers.html">global node timers</a>
will be available for tasks if nothing is given.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Logger"><span class="method name"><span class="name">Logger</span></span></h2>

<p>Any streams you want to pass to <a href="https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#readme">node-bunyan</a>, used
by both, <code>Runners</code> and <code>REST API</code>.</p>

<h1 id="demo">Demo</h1>

<p>The directory <code>examples</code> contain everything needed to illustrate:</p>

<ul>
<li>An example config file - <code>examples/config.json.sample</code> which should be
renamed to <code>examples/config.json</code> and modified to properly match your local
environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that, in order to process any <code>job</code> the <code>workflow-runner</code> needs
to be initialized pointing to the aforementioned configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/workflow-runner examples/config.json
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in order to be able to run the API based example mentioned below, the
<code>workflow-api</code> HTTP server needs to be up and running too:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/workflow-api examples/config.json
</code></pre>

<p>Contents for the other files within the <code>examples</code> directory are:</p>

<ul>
<li>An example of how to use node-workflow as a node module in order to create
workflows, queue jobs and wait for the results. See <code>examples/module.js</code>.</li>
<li>Also, an example of how to achieve same goal using Workflow API instead of
the node module. See <code>examples/api.js</code>.</li>
<li>Both examples share the same workflow definition, contained at the file
<code>examples/shared-workflow.js</code>. The beginning of the aforementioned files
can be useful to understand the differences when trying to create a workflow
using these different approaches.</li>
<li>Finally, this directory also contains a file <code>examples/node.js</code> which does
exactly the same thing than the workflow/job does - create and star a gist
using your github's username and password - but straight from NodeJS. This
file is useful in order to understand the differences between writing code
to be executed by NodeJS directly, and using it to create workflows and the
associated tasks. Remember code withing tasks runs sandboxed using
<a href="http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/vm.html">Node's VM API</a> and that tasks
are totally independent, and run each one on its own child process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, see <code>example.js</code> for more options when defining workflows and the
different possibilities for tasks fallbacks, retries, timeouts ...</p>
